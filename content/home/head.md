Smart Iris Recognition (SIR) group is affiliated to [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://www.cripac.ia.ac.cn/CN/model/index.htm),
[National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cn/index.html), [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), led by Prof. [Tieniu Tan](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/column/item80.shtml) and Prof. [Zhenan Sun](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/column/item110.shtml). SIR group concentrates on cutting-edge research of ocular biometrics, wherein the main focus is the whole pipeline of iris recognition. The topics basically include the trial-manufacture of iris imaging device, the control of iris image acquisition, iris image preprocessing, iris feature encoding and matching. Sclera recognition, periocular recognition and multi-modal fusion are also covered in the research topics for developing more advanced SIR systems. Over the years, the members of SIR group are striving to conquer the key and difficult problems in non-cooperative iris recognition at a distance under complex scenarios, promoting the applications of SIR systems in surveillance, robotics and UAVs.
