Over the past few months, the Program Committee and Area Chairs worked very hard to review each of the 164 papers submitted to IJCB 2021. The reviewers were carefully selected and assigned papers for review in their areas of expertise. A double-blind review policy was adopted. The review process resulted in the selection of the following 66 (40.2%) highly qualified papers to be included in the Technical Program.

42: **A Large-scale Database for Less Cooperative Iris Recognition**

44: **Bita-Net: Bi-temporal Attention Network for Facial Video Forgery Detection**

87: **Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Iris Recognition With Insufficient Labeled Samples**

76: **An End-to-End Autofocus Camera for Iris on the Move**

117: **Avoiding Spectacles Reflections on Iris Images Using A Ray-tracing Method**
